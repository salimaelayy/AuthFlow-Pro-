# AuthFlow Pro

Welcome to the AuthFlow Pro project! This project aims to develop an authentication management application based on roles and permissions, adopting a monorepo architecture and following the MVC model.

## Project Context

You are a Fullstack JavaScript developer committed to the realization of the "AuthFlow Pro" project. The main objective is to design an authentication management application based on roles and permissions, adopting a monorepo architecture and following the MVC model.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: React with Redux for state management.
- Backend: Node.js with Express for authentication and authorization management.
- Database: MongoDB with Mongoose for data modeling.
- API Documentation: Swagger.
- Testing: Jest or Mocha.
- Styling: Tailwind CSS.
- HTTP Requests Handling: Axios.

## Features

### Authentication and Authorization

- Configuration of a simple backend to manage authentication and authorization.
- Creation of user interface components for login, registration, and management of roles and permissions.
- Integration of Redux Toolkit for global state management, including authentication information, roles, and permissions.

### Role-based Access Control (RBAC)

- Implementation of a role system with associated permissions.
- Assignment of roles to users during registration or via an administration interface.
- Limitation of access to features based on roles and permissions.

### Redux Implementation

- Use of Redux Toolkit for efficient, simplified, and performant state management.
- Implementation of slices, actions, and reducers to handle operations related to authentication and authorization.
- Use of useDispatch and useSelector for smooth integration with React components.

### Testing

- Use of Jest or Mocha to write unit and integration tests.

### Swagger Documentation

- Integration of Swagger to document the backend API.
- Description of different routes, methods, and required parameters.
- Use of Swagger UI to make documentation accessible and interactive.

## Bonus

- Integration of Shadcn for an elegant and responsive user interface.
